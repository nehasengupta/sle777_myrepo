## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
 
data(PlantGrowth)

class(PlantGrowth)

head(PlantGrowth)

str(PlantGrowth)

mean(PlantGrowth)

class(PlantGrowth)

Plant.ctrl <- subset(PlantGrowth, group == "ctrl")[,-2] 

mean(Plant.ctrl)
#5.032

plant.trt1 <- subset(PlantGrowth, group == "trt1")[,-2]

mean(plant.trt1)

plant.trt2 <- subset(PlantGrowth, group == "trt2")[,-2]
                                                  

mean(plant.trt2)

plant.ctrl <- subset(PlantGrowth, group == "ctrl")[,-2]
median(plant.ctrl)

plant.trt1 <- subset(PlantGrowth, group == "trt1")[,-2]
median(plant.trt1)

plant.trt2 <- subset(PlantGrowth, group == "trt2")[,-2]
median(plant.trt2)




```


```{r}
# boxplot of ctrl,trt1,trt2
ctrl <- PlantGrowth[grep("ctrl",rownames(PlantGrowth)),]
trt1 <- PlantGrowth[grep("trt1",rownames(PlantGrowth)),]
trt2 <- PlantGrowth[grep("trt2",rownames(PlantGrowth))]

boxplot(weight ~group, data=PlantGrowth,
        ylab="Weight",
        xlab="Treatmens",
        main="Plan Growth under different treatments")

# Cars dataset

```{r}
head(cars)

summary(cars)

plot(cars$speed, cars$dist,
     main = "Speed vs Distance",
     xlab = "Speed",
     ylab = "Distance",
     pch = 19,
     col = "blue")
  
 
```

## Interpretation 
This scatter plot shows a positive relationship between car speed and stopping distance â€” as speed increases, the distance required to stop generally increases. The data points suggest a non-linear pattern, indicating that stopping distance grows more rapidly at higher speeds.
